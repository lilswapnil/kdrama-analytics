Kim Soo Jin (Song Ji Hyo) is a career-oriented producer at a film company that is quickly sinking into the abyss of bankruptcy. In order to save her company, she must take drastic measures -- and perhaps the most drastic of them all is adapting a film version of a webtoon by a popular but divisive writer. Bang Myung Soo (Byun Yo Han) is a young artist who has based his comic entirely on his ex-girlfriends. The intimate details of his personal life, that he has now made nationally-known household facts, has made Myung Soo something of a cross between beloved heartthrob and public enemy. It is this controversy the film company hopes to cash in on. There's just one problem: Kim Soo Jin happens to be one of those ex-girlfriends. Now, in order to make the movie, our beloved filmmaker must put her feelings aside and interact with not just her increasingly irritating ex, but also those former exes he is writing about that have once again popped up. These ladies, all former girlfriends of Myung Soo's, are older wealthy divorcee Na Ji Ah (Tree With Deep Roots actress Jang Ji Eun), the very chic and successful investment firm member Jang Hwa Young (Dream High alum Lee Yoon Ji), and airhead C-lister actress Ra Ra (Age of Youth and Descendants of the Sun's Ryu Hwa Young). Can Soo Jin make peace and learn what makes those characters tick in time to save her sinking ship of a company, or will this battle of the exes become a real-life fight club?

Ms. Perfect,6.4,Drama,55,"Ko So Yung (a beloved 90's teen idol making her comeback after ten years) and Yoon Sang Hyun (Shopping King Louis, Ms. Temper and Nam Jung Gi) star in a comedy mystery that proves that no matter how hard we try to be perfect, life has a a way of throwing chaos our way. When a dutiful wife and loving mother realizes that she has lost a sense of who she is, the fates provide a murderously good way for her to find herself. Shim Jae Bok (Ko So Yung) is a legal assistant and mother of two. She can't stand it when things are unfair. She also hates the people who look down on her because she is a working ahjumma (older woman). Plus, she's got a temper that would make sailors blush. Still, Shim Jae Bok puts up with all the condescension and false flattery around her. That is because Shim Jae Bok's life is not about her; it's about her family, and the future of her kids depends on her bowing her head and staying respectful. This means that Shim Jae Bok even puts up with the the fact that her husband Goo Jung Hee (Yoon Sang Hyun) is having an affair with the much younger Jung Na Mi (Im Se Mi from Shopping King Louis). Plus, her boss from hell Kang Bong Goo (Sung Joon from Hyde, Jekyll and I), tells her she is out of a job. Her life is in a tailspin, and then something miraculous happens. Shim Jae Bok receives an offer for an apartment from Lee Eun Hee (Jo Yeo Jung from Divorce Lawyers in Love), an offer that is way too good to be true. Suddenly, the miracle becomes a disaster. The eccentric ahjumma finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery. All the chaos in her life comes full circle, and Shim Jae Bok realizes that someone is destroying her life, piece by piece. Now, our ahjumma has to regain her true self--the kind who fights injustice and doesn't tolerate nonsense--in order to save what she has left. But when you have spent years pretending to be perfect, is it even possible to be yourself?

The Woman Who Still Wants to Marry,6.9,"Comedy,Drama,Romance",96,"A follow-up of sorts to the hit 2004 drama The Woman Who Wants to marry , this refreshing, breezy, entirely modern drama depicts the loves and friendships of three women as they each go through turning points in their lives. Comedic, witty, and addicting, The Woman Who Still Wants to Marry is a little like a Korean take on Sex and the City or Friends , and is led by a cast of appealing, charismatic actors. Park Jin Hee, a film and drama star most recently seen as the female lead in hit drama Money War (2007), takes the lead role as a woman unwilling to sacrifice her career for love. Wang Bit Na is her sophisticated, successful best friend and Uhm Ji Won is a high school classmate whom she runs into by accident. Rising star Kim Bum ( Boys Before Flowers ) rounds out the cast as a musician who falls for Jin Hee's older woman character. Shin Young (played by Jin Hee) has never been able to find success in love after breaking up with her fiance for the sake of her career. When her latest boyfriend proposes, she gladly accepts - only to find him with another woman later that night. Giving up on love, she sees another woman screaming at her boyfriend for dumping her - Jung Da Jung (Uhm Ji Won), who is a top interpreter but naive and unskilled in love. When the two realize they are old high school classmates, they quickly bond, and their trio is rounded out by Shin Young's best friend who is a successful restaurant consultant but jaded and cynical about love. With charming, stubborn gifted musician Ha Min Jae (Kim Bum) falling for Shin Young and doctor Na Ban Suk (Choi Chul Ho) becoming involved in all their lives, sparks begin to fly, and the women will need each other's help and support as they face the 30-something life with wit, humor, and sometimes something less than grace.",TV-Y,Park Jin-hee,Kim Bum,2010,\N,['In-young Kim'],"['Min-sik Kim', 'Kim Min-Shik']",tt5478360,70,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThmMDE4ODItMjhkOS00ZmM0LTgyZTgtMWEzNzIyMjE0NGYwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY266_CR2,0,180,266_.jpg"

With nowhere to go, Jung Tae visits his father's grave in Seonsan and racks his brain about how to get through this difficult time. At that moment, an old monk (Im Hyeon Shik), who is either a beggar or a monk, asks him for a drink and says that the grave site is bad, and that a fortune teller will be born for generations and ruin the family. The old monk then tells Jung Tae that the grim reaper comes and goes in his face, and tells him to look at his fortune. The old monk who read the fortune says that he has never seen such an unlucky fortune in his life and that he will die before he gets to the year of Gye-mi.
